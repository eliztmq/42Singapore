Bugs:
1. Realloc being used instead of ft_realloc *need to change back
2. Need to fix rotation axis 
3. Figure out how to rotate via centre of object and not via origin (or slow down rotation to figure this out)
5. Rotation needs to be done by x and y axis *KIV

Completed:
1. Movement to centre of window is not done properly (need to consider scale)
2. Scaling of object according to size of window to be done
3. Cannot replace original grid coord as rotation is done, will cause multiplcation effect to be
amplified while division is not visible since we are mapping float to int
