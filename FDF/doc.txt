Bugs:
1. Realloc being used instead of ft_realloc *need to change back
2. Cannot replace original grid coord as rotation is done, will cause multiplcation effect to be
amplified while division is not visible since we are mapping float to int (TBD)
3. Scaling of object according to size of window to be done
4. Movement to centre of window is not done properly (need to consider scale)
5. Rotation needs to be done by x and y axis *KIV
